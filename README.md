# EMC Solar Sailors
EMC Solar Sailors is a project from Exeter Mathematics School in which we are designing a spacecraft to harness the power of photons to get to Mars. This repo contains the code for our simulations and calculations.

See the latest simulation demo here: [simulation.mp4](https://github.com/w-henderson/EMC-Solar-Sailors/blob/master/simulation.mp4).

## Usage
Run `python planetaryPositions.py <launchDate> <massOfSpacecraft> <sailSize> <sailRotation>` to generate a simulation. Launch date is formatted as `dd/mm/yyyy`, the mass is a float in kg, the sail size is a float  in m^2, and the sail rotation is a float in degrees.
